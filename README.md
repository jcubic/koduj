Right now it's very simple playground created for teaching programming.
As first intro to programming use plotting functions.

You can introduce mathematical functions:

```
f(x) = 2x + 1
```

and show how it's created in JavaScript

https://p5.javascript.org.pl/?include=coord.js&main=plot.js&base=fn.js

it will load this JavaScript code:

```javascript
function f(x) {
    return 2 * x + 1;
}
```

And plot.js script that is hidden with help of coord.js will plot that function.
After the person get familiar with functions (connected to her/him knowledge about
functions in math) he can learn more about P5.js.
